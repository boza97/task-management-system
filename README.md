\# Task Management System



Task Management System is a web application designed to support task tracking and workflow management within a software development team.  

The system focuses on clear domain modeling, business rules, and automated testing rather than on the sheer number of features.



This project is developed as part of the \*Advanced Software Technologies\* course and is designed to be extensible for further academic work.
